/**
 * Sign-in failure classes (EX-07 S02, gap G04; plan card N01: bad data, a missing connection and a restricted account
 * each get their own recovery). A failed sign-in is told apart ONLY by what the Auth client reports, and a person sees
 * one plain message per class, never the provider's own text, code or status.
 *
 * What the installed @supabase/auth-js 2.112.4 reports (lib/fetch.ts):
 *  - no HTTP answer at all (offline, DNS, TLS, a socket timeout, an abort) is an AuthRetryableFetchError with status 0 and
 *    no code, and so is a 200 whose body is not JSON (a captive portal);
 *  - 500-504 and 520-530 are AuthRetryableFetchError with that status and NO code (the body is not read for one);
 *  - any other HTTP answer is an AuthApiError with the provider's own `code` (GoTrue: invalid_credentials,
 *    email_not_confirmed, user_banned, over_request_rate_limit, ...), or without one when the body carries none;
 *  - an error page that is not JSON, outside those statuses, is an AuthUnknownError with neither status nor code, so a
 *    rate-limit page from a proxy cannot be recognised as one.
 *
 * What the GoTrue password grant answers (supabase/auth internal/api/token.go ResourceOwnerPasswordGrant on master, read
 * 2026-10-02; the hosted DEV provider and its version were NOT probed):
 *  - an unknown email, an account without a password and a wrong password are all invalid_credentials, so no message can
 *    tell them apart; email_not_confirmed only comes after the password was right;
 *  - user_banned comes BEFORE the password is looked at (older tags, v2.100.0 and v2.158.1, answered a banned account with
 *    the generic invalid-credentials message instead). Where the provider behaves as master does, whoever types a
 *    restricted account's email, with any password, is told so. RESTRICTED_ACCOUNT relays what the provider already says
 *    to anyone who asks it and adds nothing. If that disclosure is not wanted, answer 'user_banned' with BAD_CREDENTIALS
 *    in classifySignInFailure; nothing else changes.
 *
 * Only sign-in is told apart. Sign-up and resend keep their one message each (authClientService.safeAuthFailure); phone sign-in
 * keeps its one message too, except that a restricted account is told apart there as well (owner decision 2026-10-07: signing in
 * to a banned, blocked or closed account gets its own clear message, not the generic sign-in error).
