/**
 * CANCEL-INFO (server applied to canonical DEV 2026-10-07, ledger 229): when, by which side and why a Dogovor was cancelled.
 *
 * There is no cancellation record on the server. `rpc_agreement_cancellation_v1(uuid[])` reads back what the one writer
 * (`rpc_cancel_agreement`) already leaves behind - the status and its instant, the event sent to the other side, the canceller's
 * own reason message in the conversation - and answers each of up to 100 Dogovori of the caller's. A Dogovor that is not the
 * caller's (or does not exist) is LEFT OUT of the answer without an error, and an open one is answered with `cancelled: false`
 * and every other fact null. So this service returns only the Dogovori that are cancelled; for any other id there is simply
 * nothing to say, and a screen then says nothing: it never guesses a side, a time or a reason.
 *
 * Why a separate read and not a field of the Dogovor lists: the list and workspace readers are pinned by other open work, and an
 * old client cannot be affected by a function it never calls (`supabase/candidates/cancel-info-20261007/README.md`).
 *
 * The reason is the canceller's own chat message, which both sides already read in Poruke, so nothing beyond the Dogovor is
 * disclosed. `reasonState` says what became of it: KEPT (it is here), NOT_KEPT (the pair was blocked, or an account was closing,
 * when the Dogovor was cancelled, so the reason message never existed) and REMOVED (its text was erased when an account closed).
