/**
 * PROFILE-TRUST (server applied to canonical DEV 2026-10-07, ledger 230): the worker's trust profile, in three reads.
 * The contract is `supabase/candidates/profile-trust-20261007/README.md`; this file only reads it and says what it means.
 *
 *   rpc_public_work_trust_v1(p_profile_id)  the trust block of ONE worker profile (null when there is nothing to say)
 *   rpc_my_work_stats_v1()                  the caller's own funnel "poslate prijave -> dogovoreno -> zavrseno" and reliability
 *   rpc_list_received_reviews_v1(limit, after)   the caller's received reviews, newest first, keyset-paged
 *
 * WHO SEES WHAT is the owner's open privacy decision, and the server answers it, not this client: `visibility` is `OWN_ONLY`
 * (the default: only the person themself reads the agreed count, the reliability and "member since") or `PUBLIC`; a viewer who
 * may not read them gets `reliabilityState: "HIDDEN"` and nulls, and a screen then says nothing about them. The received reviews
 * are `COMMENTED_ONLY` (the default: star-only reviews stay aggregate-only) or `ALL`. A screen draws exactly what comes back, and
 * promises nothing the server did not return (A10: no sentence may promise anonymity either).
 *
 * Every answer is validated like every receipt of this app: exact keys, the schema, `authoritative`, the account it was asked for, and
 * the states that must go together (a percentage only with AVAILABLE, nulls only with HIDDEN). A malformed answer is a failure and never
 * a half-trusted figure. Nothing is cached and nothing is written.
