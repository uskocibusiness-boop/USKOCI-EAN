/**
 * Početna (owner decision 1, 2026-09-19; the overview of the owner's information architecture, 2026-09-23): what
 * waits for this account, composed on the phone from the three reads that already exist. No mode is consulted: the
 * same account's own tasks, its applications to other people's, and its Dogovori on either side stand next to each
 * other. My own tasks and my applications are two front doors, "Moji zadaci" and "Moje prijave", each counted by the
 * same rule as the list it opens; the preview of their rows ("Moje aktivnosti") is retired, and since 2026-09-24 its
 * address redirects to Početna, so its composition is gone too.
 *
 * PKG-042 supplies server attention separately. The legacy attention composition stays as the
 * historical SQL proof oracle and test-source adapter, never a production fallback after an RPC failure.
 * The counts and the next Agreement still need complete lists: limiting their reads would lose
 * ordering and totals. Attention integration alone does not make these remaining reads bounded.
 *
 * Raspored (owner, 2026-10-07): the next accepted appointment is told day first in Serbian time, from its accepted
 * instants and from nothing else (`ui/home/raspored.ts`); no new read is made for it. With no appointment ahead, active
 * Dogovori that have no exact term, or whose exact term has passed without being marked done, are still counted in one
 * quiet line (`quietLine`), so an agreement never vanishes from Početna for want of a day to show it on.
