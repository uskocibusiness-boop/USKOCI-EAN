 * The phases of my active tasks, the groups of "Moji zadaci" ("Papir na stolu", the owner's pick of 2026-10-08): "Čeka tvoj izbor",
 * "Objavljeno", "Dogovoreno". A task is in exactly one, by what it is doing now and nothing else; drafts and the finished are not active and
 * have no phase (they are the two rows under the groups). Pure, and the same words the card's chip used to say: a group that says the
 * state is why the card does not wear the chip a second time (`OwnTaskCard`'s `sectionSays`).
 *
 * - `choosing`: it waits for MY choice, by the one rule of the app (`hasNeedAttention`: a place is open and the server counts applications
 *   to choose among), the same that counts "Čeka tvoj izbor" on Početna and said "Bira se" on the card. An unknown count is never a choice.
 * - `agreed`: someone is agreed (every place, or some of them) and nothing waits for my choice.
 * - `published`: it is out and nobody is agreed yet, whether or not an application has come.
 *
 * Its own file, and not a part of `ownTaskOverview` (the task page's model): that one reads the publication gate, which reaches the data
 * client, and a list that only groups what it was given must not load one (the screen suites would crash on it).
