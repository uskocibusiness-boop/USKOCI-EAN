 * 2026: one block of state on top, no sentence that explains): ONE state (the chip), ONE line of data (what the task has now: "Još nema
 * prijava", "3 prijave"), at most ONE green action, and the quiet ways in that the green one does not already offer. Pure: it reads the
 * task the screen already has (and, when the screen has read it, the search state for the missing places) and nothing else, so the
 * page, its tests and the list of "Moji zadaci" (`data/ownTaskStanding`, whose chip this borrows) agree on what a task is called.
 * Nothing here asks the server anything.
 *
 * Nothing is invented. A word the read cannot support is not drawn:
 * - "Bira se · N" and "Pogledaj prijave" need the server's own count of applications to choose among; an unknown count says
 *   "Pogledaj prijave" over the total the read has and never a number it does not;
 * - "Dogovor je otkazan" is said ONLY when it is certain. The search state counts every Dogovor and the places the live ones cover;
 *   a completed Dogovor covers places and a cancelled one does not, so a task that has Dogovori and covers NO place has only
 *   cancelled ones. With a place covered the same two counts cannot tell a cancelled Dogovor from a completed one, and the page
 *   then says what the task is doing now and nothing about the past;
 * - the green action is the owner's move. When there is nothing for the owner to do ("Još nema prijava"), there is no green action;
 * - a line that the chip already says is not drawn: "Dogovoren" has no line "Sva mesta su dogovorena".
