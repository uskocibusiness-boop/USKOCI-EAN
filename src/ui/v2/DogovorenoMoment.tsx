/**
 * "Dogovoreno!" (owner's pick of 2026-10-08, "Susret dva lica", C): the moment right after the person with the task chose an application.
 * It is a whole white screen, not a line in the sheet: TWO FACES, yours and the chosen person's, come toward each other 20 dp each and stop
 * overlapped by 12 (240 ms, decelerating, no bounce); the tick of an outcome plays at the instant they touch; under the faces the TASK'S
 * TITLE (the owner's own addition: "ispod avatara neka bude i naslov zadatka"), then the word, then three rows (the two of you, the term,
 * the amount) and the one green way on. No mark and no tick-shaped icon: two people meeting IS the confirmation.
 *
 * Motion is feedback and nothing else (rules of `sys.motion`): only `transform` and `opacity`, on the native driver, one short
 * `easeOut` run per part, no spring and no overshoot. The words, the term and the amount arrive in their final form; only the container
 * that carries each moves. When the Dogovor was NOT made while this screen was open (the outcome was already standing, e.g. back from
 * the profile's safety screen) it is the last frame at once and nothing ticks; reduced motion shows the last frame at once as well, and
 * keeps the tick, because a tick is an outcome and not movement (R5, R7).
 *
 * Presentation only. The one green action is the sheet's own `Otvori Dogovor` with every guard it had (the route's `openAgreement`); this
 * file only places it. It is a native Modal, as the offer sheet is, so the list under it stays exactly where the person left it, and Android
 * Back is the screen's Back (`onBack`).
