 * The one action of the app (master design plan, 2026-09-24: `V2Action` keeps its name, the old `Button` is gone).
 * Reuses existing UI-thread press feedback, system reduced motion and haptics.
 *
 * EVERY primary action is green with a white label (owner: one green primary action per screen; plan 2.18): `kind="primary"`
 * and a `brandAction` style, in any tone. `tone="neutral"` only changes the ink of a secondary or quiet control's label; it
 * never turns a primary black (it did, for `tone="neutral"` + `brandAction`, on four screens).
 * Secondary is white with a line; quiet is a link; destructive uses danger ink.
 * Existing `brandAction` callers share the same green surface and white label.
 *
 * States, each said to the eye and to a screen reader:
 * - disabled: a quiet wash with the label AND its icon in muted ink, readable (5.0:1), never a faded ghost of the live
 *   button (a white icon on the wash would vanish);
 * - disabled with a reason: the same, with the caller's reason as a muted line under the button and as the button's
 *   spoken hint (the owner's rule: a grey button always says why);
 * - loading: the button keeps its colour and its words, a spinner stands before them, it cannot be pressed twice and
 *   is spoken as busy;
 * - success: a check before the label for 1.2 s, only when the caller says the write is CONFIRMED (never on press);
 * - error: a danger outline and the caller's message right under the button, announced as an alert.
 * A line under the button is drawn inside one column with it, so a row of buttons keeps its columns; the caller's
 * place in its row (flex, width, margins) moves onto that column. A caller that passes `reason` or `error` at all (even
 * null) gets the column from the start, so the button is never rebuilt when a line appears. A reason that appears or
 * changes later is announced.
 * Every action is at least 48 px high; the primary 54, as `brandAction`.
