 * CITIES, and choosing one lists exactly its count), then the biggest cities of Serbia that have none listed above, each with what the tasks can honestly say about it:
 *   - tasks name exactly the city: it is one of the places above and is not repeated;
 *   - tasks are under parts of the city: the row leads to those parts (the place filter matches the whole text, so it cannot
 *     say "all of Beograd" and never pretends to);
 *   - no task anywhere: "Još nema zadataka", and choosing it is the ordinary place filter, which answers "no tasks yet";
 *   - places not all read: nothing is claimed, and the row leads to the places that contain the name.
 * Drilled into a city (`within`, the row that "leads to" its parts): the same rows, only those that contain its name (a letter without its diacritic finds the same
 * place), under the cities the parts of the city ("Liman, Novi Sad"), which no city row does, and a first row that goes back to the cities.
