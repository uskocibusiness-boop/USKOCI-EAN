/**
 * How the map's furniture rides the list sheet (UX plan section P). The row (the map's sources on the left, "moja lokacija" on the right)
 * stands directly above the sheet's top edge and goes up and down with it, on the UI thread: the sheet's position is a shared value, the
 * row's place is a pure function of it (`controlsTop`), and React renders nothing while the sheet moves. A pin's card that lies over the
 * map's bottom lifts the row above the card instead (`cover`). When the list is as high as it goes, no map is left above it and the row
 * fades out (`controlsFade`) instead of sinking under the list.
 *
 * Nothing here overshoots. The cover follows the card on the system's one sheet settle (critically damped, clamped: it cannot go past
 * where it is going) when the card comes up, and on the short decelerating close timing when it goes, as the card itself does; under
 * reduced motion it is simply there.
