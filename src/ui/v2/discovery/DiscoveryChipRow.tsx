 * The one row of capsules over the map, under the search pill and the round filters button (UX plan 2.13 and section P; the owner's phone of 7 and 8 Oct
 * 2026; the approved plan, U1: "Za mene · Danas · Ovaj vikend · Na daljinu · Sa iznosom", each only where the search really has it): the capsules that float
 * over the map, each raised off the tiles. It stands there at every height of the list and never moves into it: the list's own top line says only how
 * many tasks there are and in what order. It scrolls sideways, so a capsule cut by the edge says there is more.
 *
 * - "Na daljinu" comes first when available. "Za mene" follows: a capsule that is on or off, drawn only when the build says the server has the filter key (`forMeAvailable`,
 *   DISCOVERY-ZAMENE): a control that does nothing is not shown. It used to be a two-part switch beside "Svi zadaci", which said "Svi zadaci"
 *   a second time under the pill and pushed the capsules off the screen.
 * - The rest are the quick choices the search really has and the tasks can back (the screen decides which), each writing into the same
 *   state as the filters, so there are never two sources of truth. What is on and has no capsule of its own stands here too, with its own ✕, so no
 *   condition filters the list unseen. "Moja lokacija" is not here: it is not a filter, it only moves the camera, so it stands above the list.
 * - The filters are not here: they have their own round button beside the pill (`DiscoverySearchBar`).
