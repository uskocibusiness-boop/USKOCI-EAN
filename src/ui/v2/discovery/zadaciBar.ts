/**
 * The navigator owns one bar and its measured height. Discovery keeps it visible
 * during map/list browsing and reserves its space below previews and list content.
 * A selected map pin can hide navigation without resizing the inner tab controls.
 *
 * The layout (`app/(app)/_layout`) owns the bar, so it owns the one value that moves it (`hidden`: 0 the bar is on show, 1 it is away) and
 * says how tall it is (`height`, its own height and the margin under it, which is the system inset or 12). It hands both to the screen
 * through this context. ZadaciNavigationBar moves a separate host; zadaciBarStyle keeps the inner geometry static. The screen
 * keeps the bar shown at all three list detents, and hides it during a selected-pin preview (`useZadaciBarMotion`). Without a layout (a gallery, a test) there is no context, and the screen draws and does as it did
 * without a bar: nothing is reserved and nothing moves.
