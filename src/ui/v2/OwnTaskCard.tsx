/**
 * One of MY tasks in the "Moji zadaci" list (plan 2.2 and 3.5, owner 2026-10-07; composition spec 4.5, 2026-10-08). It is a
 * `Surface record` of about 200 dp where it used to be 304, because it says the same things in one rhythm (16 inside, 12 between
 * the parts), and since the owner's phone of 8 Oct 2026 in the SAME words as the card of the Zadaci family (one card look):
 *
 *   1. the state, as the app's one `StatusChip` in the owner's eight words (Nacrt, Objavljen, Bira se · N, Dogovoren, U toku, Završen,
 *      Otkazan, Istekao); every row that has an honest word wears one (`ownTaskStanding` says which, and says nothing it cannot
 *      support). HITNO keeps its badge beside the chip (a word with a symbol, never a colour alone); it counts only until the
 *      server's expiry, on one clock;
 *   2. the title (18/24, two lines at most; the whole of it is what a screen reader hears);
 *   3. the facts as rows of one kind, each with its picture: what it pays (the sum with what it buys, or the price tag and "Tražim ponude"; a
 *      word is never drawn as an amount), where, when and, ONLY when it is more than one, how many people ("Treba 3 osobe"; "0/1" said nothing);
 *   4. the ONE line of data ("Još nema prijava", "3 prijave"). When it is the way to the applications waiting for my choice it is the card's
 *      foot ("noga"), its own target under a line and never inside the body: one touch to the applications instead of two. Only a task that
 *      waits for my decision has a foot; any other line is a quiet line of the body, and a draft has none.
 *
 * "Čeka prijave" is not a word of this row: it said "has applications" and read as "has none". The body opens the task, as it always
 * did. The frame gives under the finger as ONE object (`usePressLift`, the row rung, 0.985), and nothing moves under reduced motion.
 * The requirement of the task (a vehicle, a tool) is not drawn here: I wrote it, and the task shows it.
