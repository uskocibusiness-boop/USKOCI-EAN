/**
 * Moji zadaci, "Papir na stolu" (the owner's pick of 2026-10-08): the person's own ACTIVE tasks in groups by what each one is doing now
 * ("Čeka tvoj izbor · 2", "Objavljeno · 2", "Dogovoreno · 1"; `ownTaskPhases`), the cards under each group's name, and under the groups two
 * quiet rows, "Nacrti" and "Istorija", each with how many it holds. There are no tabs: either groups or tabs, never both. A group says the
 * state, so the card does not wear the state chip a second time (`sectionSays`); HITNO keeps its badge. A row that is touched opens that set
 * in this screen (`view.section` is `drafts` or `history`): the bar then says its name and its arrow comes back to the groups. In the list
 * of drafts the card says nothing about its state either (the list is that state); in the history it keeps its chip, because Istorija holds
 * three different endings (Završen, Otkazan, Istekao).
 *
 * The FIRST ENCOUNTER is a promise (B6, "Predmet vrata"): a person with no task at all sees the paper with the pin and the pencil at 144,
 * the same object as the door "Objavi zadatak" on Početna, "Još nemaš zadatak", one sentence, one green action and one quiet way.
 *
 * The cards are `Surface record`s of about 200 dp, 12 apart, three to a screen (composition spec 4.5). A group's name is 12 above its first
 * card and 24 below the last card of the one before; the rows of the finished stand 24 under the last. A number in a group's name is the
 * count of what the list holds, and is drawn only when it is exact: the whole list's own count, or a paged read that has read to its end (never
 * the number that happens to be loaded). The counts of Nacrti and Istorija are the whole list's own or the server's, and a set that holds
 * nothing has no row; while a filter is on they say only their names (a count of everything would not be what the set will show).
 *
 * FILTERI stays what it was (decision of 2026-10-08: the look is A, the function is not lost): the one control of the bar, at its end,
 * with its word beside the drawing. It opens the sheet with the search field, the way of pricing and "Čeka tvoj izbor", and applies them
 * together to the set that is shown (the groups, or the list of drafts or of the history); the sheet promises how many tasks the list will
 * show, by the same rule Apply uses. The control is not drawn for a person who has nothing to narrow down, and a filter that came back empty
 * keeps it, because it is how the filter is cleared. A filter that is on says so in the control ("Filteri, aktivni").
 *
 * Other people's tasks are the Zadaci tab (`DiscoveryPresentation`). My own tasks carry no creation action over their cards
 * (Početna has "Objavi zadatak"); an empty list still offers it inline. Presentation only: every callback is the route's existing command.
 *
 * No eyebrow above the title (owner, 2026-09-23): "Moje aktivnosti" over "Moji zadaci" only said where you are, and that destination is retired.
