/**
 * MY application in a list (owner's step 5c, 2026-09-24; one object for both people since 2026-10-07, plan 2.12; one `Surface record`
 * since 2026-10-08, composition spec 4.7). The content is the shared `PrijavaCard` (the state as the app's one `StatusChip`, the TASK's
 * title, then the term, the offer and the people on one line, and my message); this file is the worker's side of it:
 *
 *   - what each state of the read is called (the owner's five words: Poslata, Viđena, Izabrana, Nije izabrana, Povučena);
 *   - the interactive shell: the body opens the task, a long note has a separate read-only control to open its complete text,
 *     and the foot holds at most ONE action, the one this state allows, as a quiet row link under a line (never a button inside the card,
 *     and never green for a withdrawal): Izabrana → "Otvori Dogovor", an open one the server lets me withdraw → "Povuci prijavu" (a
 *     quiet ink link; the danger colour is kept for the question it opens), a changed task → "Pregledaj izmene zadatka" (the one
 *     orange dot of the card); nothing for a state that is over.
 *
 * The body opens the task the application belongs to, as it always did. The foot is its own press, a sibling of the body. The frame
 * gives under the finger as ONE object (`usePressLift`, the row rung), and nothing moves under reduced motion.
 *
 * Two of the read's states say more than the five words do, and the card says it in a line beside the chip rather than in a sixth word:
 * STALE_REVIEW_REQUIRED is still the application that was SENT, but the task changed under it ("Zadatak je izmenjen"); CLOSED merges an
 * application that was not chosen, one that expired and one whose task closed (private.my_application_state), so it is "Nije izabrana"
 * and the line says what is true of all three, "Zadatak više ne prima prijave", never a reason the read does not know.
