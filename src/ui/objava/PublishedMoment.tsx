/**
 * "Objavljeno" (plan 2.9, owner 2026-10-07; "Papir i pečat", owner's pick of 2026-10-08): the one calm moment right after a publication the
 * server has confirmed. Until 2026-10-07 the success was replaced by the jump to the map in the same breath, so nobody ever saw it. The
 * moment is the paper with a pin and a pencil (144, the picture of a task laid on the table), which settles in once as the picture of an
 * empty state does (`Arrive`); the pill "Objavljen" then falls onto it beside the title like a stamp (`Pecat`: tilted, 140 ms, no bounce, one
 * light tick as it lands); what happened and ONE green way on. Nothing else moves and nothing else is said (the owner, 8 Oct 2026: the grey line about
 * where the applications can be seen, "Prijave vidiš ovde i u zvoncu.", explained what the green action already is). Under reduced motion the picture and the pill are there at once and the tick stays (a tick is an outcome, not movement).
 *
 * It holds `PUBLISHED_MOMENT_MS` when left alone and then continues by itself; a tap on the green action, or Android Back (the
 * route wires that), continues at once. It never blocks the way on. A screen reader is not hurried: while one is on, the moment
 * waits for the person to continue, because a sentence that is still being read must not be cut off by a screen change.
 *
 * The green action sits in the middle, under the words, and not at the foot where "Objavi zadatak" was: a second tap meant for
 * the publish button must not land on the way on and skip the moment before it was seen.
