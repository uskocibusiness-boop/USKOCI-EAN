/**
 * The overview of a Dogovor (Pregled), composed ONCE for the route and for its gallery (composition spec 4.9, template T3): the head
 * with the work's name and where the Dogovor stands; the note for a Dogovor with no term (R02); a reported problem and the three
 * ways on after it (R04); the terms; the people of a group; the number and the place; the rows that lead elsewhere; and, last, what can
 * be done - "Izmeni uslove" and "Prijavi problem" (the form that reports one takes the place of its row), then, apart and in red,
 * "Otkaži Dogovor" and "Prijavi ili blokiraj osobu" (J15: the actions are on the page and in no menu). Sections are parted by the space of the
 * scroll it stands in (24) and by nothing else - no line, no box.
 *
 * It decides nothing: whether a row is drawn is whether the route handed it a command (`on`), and what each command does, behind which
 * guard, is the route's. It reads nothing and writes nothing. It is meant to be the children of the page's own scroll
 * (`overviewContent`), so its blocks become that scroll's children and the scroll's gap is the only space between them.
