/**
 * The row of a list of things that HAPPENED (UI/UX pass, 2026-10-08, the owner's phone: Obaveštenja and Poruke): a picture or a face in
 * its slot, the thing's name with the time at the end of the same line, and the lines under it. The system's `ListRow` has no place for
 * a time and never cuts a line, which is right for a settings list and wrong for a list of events, where the time is what a person scans
 * for and a long preview must not make the row three times as tall as the one above it. When the system's row learns a time and the number
 * of lines it may take, this file goes and the two lists take that one (the same arrangement as `ListSkeleton`).
 *
 * 64 dp high at the least, 12 above and below, the slot and the words 12 apart, and the divider the system's rows have: 1 dp, from where
 * the words begin to the right edge, drawn by the row and not by the list. The name takes the room the time leaves; the time never wraps
 * and never gives way. The whole row is the one press, and a row that cannot be pressed now goes grey. It draws no arrow: the time is
 * what stands at its end, and every row of these two lists is opened by a touch anyway.
 *
 * `time` is the word at the end of the name's line ("18:42", "Juče"); a caller that has no room for it at a large text size leaves it out
 * and says it in a line of its own. What a screen reader hears is the caller's `accessibilityLabel`, always the whole of the row.
