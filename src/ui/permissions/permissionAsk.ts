/**
 * Permissions are asked in context (owner decisions 2026-09-16 and 2026-10-07, design proposal N): never at entry, and never
 * as a bare system window. Right before the system asks, a small dialog says in one question why, with a picture, a green
 * "Nastavi" and a quiet "Ne sada". The system window follows only on "Nastavi"; "Ne sada" leaves the app usable and says
 * nothing more.
 *
 * The green word is "Nastavi", not "Dozvoli" (F7, 2026-10-08): this dialog grants nothing, it only explains and goes on to the
 * system's own question, and a person who taps "Dozvoli" believes the permission is given and is then asked again. The same rule
 * as the platforms' own guidance for a question that comes before the system's (the word is Continue, never Allow).
 *
 * This module is the store the features talk to, in the same shape as `poruka` (ui/system/Poruka): a feature asks and awaits,
 * and the host (`PermissionAskHost`, mounted once at the root) draws the dialog. It holds no React and no native module, so the
 * voice, media and location code can use it without pulling a screen in. WHAT is requested from the system stays where it was;
 * this only decides whether the person is told why first.
