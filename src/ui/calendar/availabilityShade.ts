 * The thin shade under a day number in the planner's week (owner, 2026-10-07): "on this day I have said I can work". It is
 * read from the availability the worker already keeps (`workerAvailabilityClientService.read`): the weekly rules and the dated
 * exceptions of Dostupnost. It says nothing about being booked (a Dogovor on the day is a Dogovor, drawn as one) and nothing
 * about "Mogu odmah" (that switch is about now, not about a day).
 *
 * The availability is kept in its own named zone and the planner's days are Serbian days, so every rule is turned into exact
 * instants first and only then cut by the Serbian day. A person who keeps Dostupnost in another zone sees the shade where the
 * hours really fall in Serbian time.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no native module, no read of the phone's zone.
