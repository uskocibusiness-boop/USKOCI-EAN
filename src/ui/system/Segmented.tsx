 * THE TWO SHAPES (composition spec 2026-10-07, U7 and section 3: the old control scrolled sideways from two options on, and at the
 * owner's text size it cut "Istorija 7" and "Moje pr…", so a person could not tell what was there):
 *
 * - UP TO THREE OPTIONS share the width EQUALLY, in a quiet track that never scrolls and never cuts a word: the track is 56 dp
 *   (a 48 dp tab and 4 around it), the chosen tab is a white pill with heavier type, so shape and weight carry the state, never
 *   colour alone; at a large text size the words go to a second line instead.
 * - FOUR OR MORE are `chips`: 48 dp chips in a row that scrolls sideways, the one place in the app that does, and that runs to the
 *   edges of the screen (`bleed`) so a chip goes under the edge and not under a strip of white. The chosen chip is a quiet well with
 *   an ink edge. Nothing about it is cut, because it scrolls instead.
 *
 * `contentSized` and `scroll` stay accepted so that no call breaks, and the layout ignores them: a set of up to three is equal and
 * still, a set of four or more is chips. (`scroll` still keeps the tab's give waiting for the press delay, as a row in a scrolling
 * list does, because a finger that lands there may be the start of a scroll.) `appearance="underline"` is the older tab strip and
 * is not changed.
 *
 * SHARING A ROW (F8b, at F2's request). A track fills the width it is given, as every control of a screen does, so a set that stands in a
 * row beside another control (an icon button, a pill) has two ways to say how wide it is. Either it is wrapped in a `View` with `flex: 1`,
 * and the track takes what the other control leaves (the Dogovori bar: tabs, then the Raspored button), or it is `inline`: the track is as
 * wide as its words need and no wider, so it can sit beside the other control with no number of dp of its own. An `inline` set is not
 * of equal shares (each tab is its own word and 16 on each side) and it shrinks, its words going to a second line, before it pushes the
 * other control out of the row. In a column it is the width of its words at the left; give it `style={{ alignSelf: 'flex-start' }}`
 * there. Four or more options are chips, which already are the width of their words, so `inline` changes nothing for them.
 *
 * Each segment is a tab for screen readers. A count is drawn only for what waits for the person (`badgeTone="attention"`).
 *
 * The fixed pill and underline use measured native transforms. Selection semantics change immediately;
 * the indicator follows over the toggle duration, or settles immediately under reduced motion. Until
 * the selected segment is measured it paints its own selection, so the first frame is never empty.
