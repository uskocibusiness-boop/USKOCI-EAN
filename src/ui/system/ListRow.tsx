 * were each drawn their own way, so the text began 0, 44, 46, 48, 52, 56 or 68 dp from the edge and a divider ran to a different
 * place on every screen. Here the text starts at one place (`layout.slot` + 12 = 52 with a picture, 68 with a face, 0 without),
 * and the divider under the row runs from there to the right edge: 1 dp, `line`, "inset".
 *
 * The row is 64 dp high with a second line or a picture and 56 without, 12 dp of padding above and below, 12 dp between its
 * parts. A row that is touched has the arrow; a row that only tells has neither the arrow nor a press (so nothing that looks like
 * a link goes nowhere), and neither does a red row, which is a command and not a way onward. At a large text size the node at the end goes under the words instead of crushing them. Nothing is cut
 * with an ellipsis, and the press gives on the `row` rung of the press ladder (0.985; the spec said 0.99, and
 * `one-token-source` allows no literal).
 *
 * A row that SETS something says its answer at its end (`value`: "Novi Sad", in grey, before the caret), and a row that opens something in
 * place says whether it is open (`expanded`: the caret down when closed, up when open, and the state spoken); a settings row that opens
 * its choices under itself is both ("Gde", "Novi Sad", caret down). Neither changes a row that does not say it.
