/**
 * What the app says when something did not go as asked (UI/UX pass 2026-10-08, F8b; text revision 2026-10-07, finding 4 and the
 * vocabulary table). The words were written screen by screen: "Proveri ishod", "Učitaj sačuvano stanje", "Osveži stanje", "Prikaži
 * aktuelno stanje" were 36 different buttons for one idea, and about 350 sentences said "ishod nije potvrđen", "sačuvano stanje" or
 * "zahtev" in a language nobody speaks. This is the one table. A screen imports a line from here; it does not write its own.
 *
 * THE FIVE SITUATIONS, told apart by what the app KNOWS (never by what it fears):
 *
 *   failed       it knows nothing was saved ("Nije uspelo", the button is `retry`);
 *   uncertain    it asked, and no answer came back, so it does not know ("Ne znamo da li je uspelo", the one button is `check`);
 *   offline      the phone has no connection ("Nema internet veze");
 *   unavailable  the connection is fine and the service is not ("Usluga trenutno nije dostupna");
 *   cannotLoad   a read that did not arrive, cause not known yet ("Ne možemo da učitamo Dogovore").
 *
 * Writing `failed` for something that may have been saved is a lie that gets a person to send a task twice; when in doubt it is
 * `uncertain`, and the person is given the one button that finds out.
 *
 * THE RULES OF THE WORDS (what `stateRules.ts` holds as checks):
 *   - the title says what is the matter, in one line and without a full stop; the copy says why or what to do, in one or two sentences;
 *   - the copy NEVER repeats the verb of the button: a state that says "pokušaj ponovo" and offers a button "Pokušaj ponovo" says it twice,
 *     so the copy describes and the button commands;
 *   - "mi" for the app ("Ne možemo", "Ne znamo"), "ti" for the person, no grammatical gender, no "server", no "ishod", no "zahtev" for a
 *     thing the person did, no "Probaj" ("Pokušaj").
