/**
 * The one place a haptic tick is made (UI/UX pass, motion item M-03; `MOTION_I_POLISH_SPEC_20261007.md` A6).
 *
 * WHEN a tick happens is the caller's: rule R5 of `sys.motion` says a tick is an outcome, never a touch, so a control ticks
 * when its tap completes (`Press`), a result ticks when the server confirmed it, and navigation ticks nothing. HOW it feels
 * is this file's, and it differs by platform:
 *
 * - iOS plays the system generators: `selectionAsync`, `impactAsync` and `notificationAsync` are the Taptic Engine's own.
 * - Android plays the system's own haptic constants through `performAndroidHapticsAsync` (`View.performHapticFeedback`),
 *   which is what the platform recommends and which, called without flags as `expo-haptics` does, follows the person's
 *   "touch feedback" setting (a phone with it off is silent, which is right). The three calls above are plain vibrator
 *   waveforms there (the module's own timings and amplitudes, whatever that setting says), and that is how the app used to
 *   make every tick. Those waveforms stay as the fallback.
 *
 * On Android a constant the system does not have is not silent: the module rejects (`HapticsNotSupportedException`).
 * `Confirm`, `Reject` and the gesture pair arrived with Android 11 (API 30), `Segment_Tick`, `Toggle_On` and `Toggle_Off` with
 * Android 14 (API 34; the Android SDK's `api-versions.xml`), and only `Clock_Tick`, `Context_Click`, `Keyboard_Tap`,
 * `Long_Press` and `Virtual_Key` exist everywhere (`expo-haptics` `HapticsRecord.kt` refuses the rest on an older system). A
 * phone on Android 12 or 13 therefore has no `Segment_Tick`. Each kind lists the constants it would like, in order, then the
 * vibrator form, then nothing.
 *
 * A tick is never worth a crash or a lost tap: nothing here throws or rejects. No haptics engine, a native module that is
 * missing, a build whose JS is newer than its native half, a test double: all of it is silence.
 *
 * A tick is not movement, so it does NOT follow "reduce motion" (R5 and R7, spec A6 and A7): a person who asked for less
 * motion has not asked for less feedback. This file therefore never reads the reduced-motion store.
 *
 * "Less is more": two ticks closer than `sys.motion.tickGap` feel like one buzz. Of two ticks inside the gap the heavier one
 * plays and a lighter or equal one is dropped, so an outcome (a sent message confirmed) is never held back by the touch
 * that caused it. Weights follow the spec's levels: choice (1) < action and gesture (2) < destructive confirm (3) < outcome (4).
 *
 * The mapping to Android constants is the spec's table, SOURCE only until it has been felt on the HONOR (spec A6: a
 * hypothesis for that probe); the table below is the one place to change it.
